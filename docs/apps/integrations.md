## Node.js

If you are developing your app's backend in a node.js environment, we highly recommend using the TRTL apps NPM package. The package is fully documented and provides typed, promise-based API function calls and many useful helper functions.

You can find the [NPM package here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/trtl-apps), and the [full API documentation here.](https://zoidbergza.github.io/turtle-apps-node/classes/_trtlapp_.trtlapp.html)
